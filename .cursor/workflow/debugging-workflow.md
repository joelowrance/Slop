# Debugging Workflow

## Overview
Systematic approach to debugging issues in the VerdaVidaLawnCare application, ensuring efficient problem resolution and knowledge sharing.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Issue Identification
- **Reproduce the Issue**: Ensure you can consistently reproduce the problem
- **Gather Information**: Collect error messages, logs, and user reports
- **Identify Scope**: Determine if it's a frontend, backend, or database issue
- **Check Recent Changes**: Review recent commits and deployments
- **Prioritize Severity**: Assess impact on users and business operations

### 2. Initial Investigation
- **Check Logs**: Review application logs for error details
- **Examine Stack Traces**: Identify the exact location of failures
- **Verify Environment**: Ensure issue exists in the correct environment
- **Test in Isolation**: Try to isolate the problem to specific components
- **Check Dependencies**: Verify external services and database connectivity

### 3. Root Cause Analysis
- **Trace Execution Path**: Follow the code execution from entry point to failure
- **Check Data Flow**: Verify data is being passed correctly between layers
- **Validate Assumptions**: Question assumptions about how the code should work
- **Review Business Logic**: Ensure business rules are implemented correctly
- **Check Configuration**: Verify settings and environment variables

### 4. Solution Development
- **Design Fix**: Plan the solution considering impact and side effects
- **Consider Alternatives**: Evaluate different approaches to solving the problem
- **Test Solution**: Verify the fix works in isolation
- **Check Dependencies**: Ensure the fix doesn't break other functionality
- **Document Changes**: Record what was changed and why

### 5. Implementation & Testing
- **Apply Fix**: Implement the solution in the appropriate environment
- **Test Thoroughly**: Verify the fix resolves the issue completely
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure no new issues are introduced
- **Performance Testing**: Check that the fix doesn't impact performance
- **User Acceptance**: Verify the fix meets user expectations

### 6. Documentation & Prevention
- **Document Root Cause**: Record the underlying cause of the issue
- **Update Documentation**: Modify relevant documentation if needed
- **Add Monitoring**: Implement better monitoring to catch similar issues
- **Improve Tests**: Add tests to prevent regression
- **Share Knowledge**: Inform team about the issue and solution

## Debugging Tools & Techniques

### Logging Analysis
```csharp
// Structured logging for debugging
_logger.LogInformation("Processing customer {CustomerId} with data {@CustomerData}", 
    customerId, customerData);

// Error logging with context
_logger.LogError(ex, "Failed to create appointment for customer {CustomerId} at {DateTime}", 
    customerId, DateTime.UtcNow);
```

### Database Debugging
```csharp
// Enable sensitive data logging in development
protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
{
    if (!optionsBuilder.IsConfigured)
    {
        optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(connectionString)
                     .EnableSensitiveDataLogging()
                     .EnableDetailedErrors();
    }
}
```

### API Debugging
```csharp
// Add request/response logging middleware
app.UseMiddleware<RequestResponseLoggingMiddleware>();

// Enable detailed error pages in development
if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    app.UseSwagger();
    app.UseSwaggerUI();
}
```

## Common Debugging Scenarios

### 1. Database Issues
- **Connection Problems**: Check connection strings and network connectivity
- **Query Performance**: Use SQL Server Profiler or similar tools
- **Data Integrity**: Verify foreign key constraints and data relationships
- **Migration Issues**: Check if database schema matches entity models

### 2. API Issues
- **Authentication Failures**: Verify JWT tokens and user permissions
- **Validation Errors**: Check model validation and error messages
- **Serialization Problems**: Ensure DTOs are properly configured
- **CORS Issues**: Verify cross-origin request settings

### 3. Frontend Issues
- **JavaScript Errors**: Use browser developer tools to identify issues
- **API Communication**: Check network requests and responses
- **State Management**: Verify component state and data flow
- **UI Rendering**: Check CSS and responsive design issues

### 4. Performance Issues
- **Slow Queries**: Analyze database query execution plans
- **Memory Leaks**: Use profiling tools to identify memory issues
- **Caching Problems**: Verify cache invalidation and hit rates
- **Resource Contention**: Check for blocking operations
